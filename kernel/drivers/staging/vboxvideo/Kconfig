	  This is a KMS driver for the virtual Graphics Card used in
	  Virtual Box virtual machines.

	  Although it is possible to builtin this module, it is advised
	  to build this driver as a module, so that it can be updated
	  independently of the kernel. Select M to built this driver as a
	  module and add support for these devices via drm/kms interfaces.

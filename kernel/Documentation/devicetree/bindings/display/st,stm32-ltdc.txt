* STMicroelectronics STM32 lcd-tft display controller

- ltdc: lcd-tft display controller host
  must be a sub-node of st-display-subsystem
  Required properties:
  - compatible: "st,stm32-ltdc"
  - reg: Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory mapped region.
  - clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each
    entry in 'clock-names'.
  - clock-names: A list of clock names. For ltdc it should contain:
      - "lcd" for the clock feeding the output pixel clock & IP clock.
  - resets: reset to be used by the device (defined by use of RCC macro).
  Required nodes:
    - Video port for RGB output.

Example:

/ {
	...
	soc {
	...
		ltdc: display-controller@40016800 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-ltdc";
			reg = <0x40016800 0x200>;
			interrupts = <88>, <89>;
			resets = <&rcc STM32F4_APB2_RESET(LTDC)>;
			clocks = <&rcc 1 CLK_LCD>;
			clock-names = "lcd";

			port {
				ltdc_out_rgb: endpoint {
				};
			};
		};
	};
};

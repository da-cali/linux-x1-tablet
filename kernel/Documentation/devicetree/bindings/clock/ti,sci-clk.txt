Texas Instruments TI-SCI Clocks
===============================

All clocks on Texas Instruments' SoCs that contain a System Controller,
are only controlled by this entity. Communication between a host processor
running an OS and the System Controller happens through a protocol known
as TI-SCI[1]. This clock implementation plugs into the common clock
framework and makes use of the TI-SCI protocol on clock API requests.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be "ti,k2g-sci-clk"
- #clock-cells: Shall be 2.
  In clock consumers, this cell represents the device ID and clock ID
  exposed by the PM firmware. The assignments can be found in the header
  files <dt-bindings/genpd/<soc>.h> (which covers the device IDs) and
  <dt-bindings/clock/<soc>.h> (which covers the clock IDs), where <soc>
  is the SoC involved, for example 'k2g'.

Examples:
--------

pmmc: pmmc {
	compatible = "ti,k2g-sci";

	k2g_clks: clocks {
		compatible = "ti,k2g-sci-clk";
		#clock-cells = <2>;
	};
};

uart0: serial@2530c00 {
	compatible = "ns16550a";
	clocks = <&k2g_clks 0x2c 0>;
};

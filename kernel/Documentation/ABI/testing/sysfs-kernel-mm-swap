Description:	Enable/disable VMA based swap readahead.

		If set to true, the VMA based swap readahead algorithm
		will be used for swappable anonymous pages mapped in a
		VMA, and the global swap readahead algorithm will be
		still used for tmpfs etc. other users.  If set to
		false, the global swap readahead algorithm will be
		used for all swappable pages.

Description:	The max readahead size in order for VMA based swap readahead

		VMA based swap readahead algorithm will readahead at
		most 1 << max_order pages for each readahead.  The
		real readahead size for each readahead will be scaled
		according to the estimation algorithm.
